## 🧠 Executive Summary
The **Aegis Proxy** is a high-performance security interceptor designed to solve the "AI Data Leakage" crisis. As organizations integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their workflows, sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is often leaked into public training sets. This platform intercepts user prompts, sanitizes sensitive data in real-time, and secures raw evidence via **AES-256 encryption**, transforming AI from a liability into a secure enterprise asset.

## 🏗️ The "Triple-Threat" Architecture

| 1. The Engine 🤖 | 2. The Shield 🛡️ | 3. The Strategy ⚖️ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Data Intelligence** | **Information Security** | **GRC & Governance** |
| • **PII Scrubbing:** Detects SSNs, Emails, and Credit Cards. | • **Evidence Vaulting:** AES-256 symmetric encryption. | • **Non-Repudiation:** Defensible audit trail for GRC. |
| • **Contextual Redaction:** Replaces values with placeholders. | • **Zero-Knowledge:** Inaccessible without Master Key. | • **Data Sovereignty:** Secure `.env` and Azure protocols. |
